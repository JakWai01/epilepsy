Reverse egineering epilepsy

>‚ÄúPeople think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don't have any idea what causes epilepsy. But I believe that someday we will understand what causes epilepsy, and at that moment, we will cease to believe that it's divine. And so it is with everything in the universe‚Äù - Hippocrates

## Notes 

### Intro 
- Group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures
- Seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking
- Isolated seizures such as seizures caused by poison are not deemed to represent epilepsy 
- The underlying mechanism is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the **cortex of the brain**. The reason for that is mostly unknown.
- Some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain or birth defects through a process known as **epileptogenesis**. Genetic mutations are linked to a small number of cases.
- Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG)
- In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, surgery, **neurostimulation** or dietary changes may then be considered. Sometimes nothing seems to help 

### Seizures 
- Most seizures are convulsive. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain. Two begin as focal seizure (which effect one hemisphere of the brain). The remaining percentage of seizures is non-convulsive e.g. absence seizures
- Focal seizures are often preceded by certain experiences, known as auras. They include sensual (visual, hearing or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena.
- There are six types of generalized seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence and atonic seizures. They all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning
- **Tonic-clonic seizures** occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by an extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10-30 seconds (the tonic phase). A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles, followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison (clonic phase). **Tonic seizures** produce constant contractions of the muscles. After the shaking has stopped it may take 10-30 minutes for the person to return back to normal; this period is called the **postictal phase**
- **Myonic seizures** involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over. **Absence seizures** can be subtle with only  a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. **Atonic seizures** involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second.
- About 6% of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping. (Are epileptic seizures related to dreams in some way?)
