Reverse egineering epilepsy

>‚ÄúPeople think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don't have any idea what causes epilepsy. But I believe that someday we will understand what causes epilepsy, and at that moment, we will cease to believe that it's divine. And so it is with everything in the universe‚Äù - Hippocrates

## Notes 

### Intro 
- Group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures
- Seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking
- Isolated seizures such as seizures caused by poison are not deemed to represent epilepsy 
- The underlying mechanism is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain. The reason for that is mostly unknown.
- Some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis. Genetic mutations are linked to a small number of cases.
- Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG)
- In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes may then be considered. Sometimes nothing seems to help
